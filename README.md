### 1. **Project Structure**
Your project should have the following structure:

```
Acadia/
│
├── data/               # Directory for input datasets
├── output/             # Directory for generated reports and plots
├── src/                # Python scripts for processing
│   ├── analysis.py     # Script for data analysis and report generation
├── README.md           # Project description and links
└── requirements.txt    # Python dependencies
```

---

### 2. **Python Script: Data Analysis and Report Generation**
Here's a script (`src/analysis.py`) to generate reports and save them in the `output/` directory.

### 3. **README.md**
Create a `README.md` file to describe the project and provide a link to the generated report.

```markdown
# Acadia: Data Science for Missing Data

## Overview
Acadia automates data analysis, focusing on detecting and visualizing missing values, categorizing columns by data type, and generating comprehensive reports.

## Features
- Detects missing values and generates a detailed summary.
- Categorizes columns into numeric and categorical data types.
- Creates box plots for numeric columns.
- Outputs a downloadable PDF report with visualizations.

## Usage
1. Place your dataset in the `data/` directory (e.g., `dataset.csv`).
2. Run the analysis script:
   ```bash
   python src/analysis.py
   ```
3. Find the generated report in the `output/` directory.

## Report
The generated report can be accessed [here](https://github.com/sudhan670/Acadia/blob/main/Data%20Report.pdf).

## Dependencies
Install required libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn fpdf
```
```Juptyer Notebooks or Colab
!pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn fpdf
## License
This project is licensed under the MIT License.

### 4. **Hosting on GitHub**
- Push your project to a GitHub repository.
- Ensure the `Data_Report.pdf` file is in the `output/` folder and included in your commit.
- Update the README link to point to the correct GitHub path.

This setup ensures the project is well-organized, with clear instructions and a functional link to the generated report. Let me know if you need further adjustments or enhancements!
